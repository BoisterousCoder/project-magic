Project Magic will now be depreciated as the project should be resurected in the near future as project-cardboard with more up to date frameworks as this project has been left un attended for a long while now. This has become nessesary as the project has become difficult to work on the old frameworks that have had their documention updated for new versions that this project is not using. During this transition project cardboard should also do some refactoring as some of the names have become very confusing.

# ProjectMagic

This project's server side was generated with [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) version 4.15.0

This project's client side was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0. 

## Compile The Client

Run `npm run build` in the root directory, to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `public/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running Server side

Run `npm run start` in the root directory, to start the server. The client will remain unchanged from the last build.

## Code Structure

All client source files is located in the `src/` directory, and all server source files are located in the `server/` directory. 

## Install instructions

1. Ensure that you have cloned the project (perferably using github desktop).
2. Download version 6 of [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) 
3. Open GIT SHELL
4. Run `cd ./project-magic`, to navigate the project's root folder
5. Install Angular CLI with the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`
6. Run `npm install pug pug-ng-html-loader` to install the pug templating engine
7. Install all other modules with the command `npm install`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Further Angular CLI help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## The Discord
