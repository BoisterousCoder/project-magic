movementMap
    A place that a unit can move is represented by a 1 and where they cant is a 0.
    The unit's current location is the center of the map.
    A movement map is made of an array of arrays.
    Each of the arrays that are contained in the larger array represent a layer.
    Each Layer is a square moving away from the center.
    The unit's current location is the 0th layer.
    Below is a figure showing which tiles are represented by which layers.

    3210123

    This patter continues indefinately.
    Any tile left undefined will default to 0.
    The location of the tile in the layer's array starts at the top and follows the square clockwise, as demonstated below.

    Here is an example map.
    [
        [1]
        [0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1],
        [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
    ]
    This is what the map is attemoting to represent.

    Try to make these maps interesting but symetrical. 
    A map the is not symetrical could give one player an advantage over the other.

Notes:
    The movement action must always be included.
