movementMap
    A place that a unit can move is represented by a 1 and where they cant is a 0.
    The unit's current location is the center of the map, and will be represent as a - for example puroses.
    A movement map is made of an array of arrays.
    Each of the arrays that are contained in the larger array represent a layer.
    Each Layer is a square moving away from the center.
    The unit's current location does not count as a layer will.
    Below is a figure showing which tiles are represented by which layers.

    This patter continues indefinately.
    Any tile left undefined will default to 0.
    The location of the tile in the layer's array starts at the bottom and follows the circle counter clockwise, as demonstated below.

    Here is an example map.
    [
        [0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1],
        [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
    ]
    This is what the map is attemoting to represent.
