I do not currently intend for other people to contribute to the project. However, if anyone feels like helping or even just giving me pointers, it would be apreaciated, especially if you are an artist. When contributing, just make sure that your code doesn't break anything that isn't already broken and I'll probably accept it. I have set up a sort of to do list with the issues tab, you can look there for stuff to do, just please get in contact with me first over [Discord](https://discord.gg/PURpPSr) before you do anything.
